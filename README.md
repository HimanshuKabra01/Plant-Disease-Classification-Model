# 📖Overview
This project involves training a deep learning model to detect and classify diseases in plant leaves using a well-organized training and testing dataset. The aim is to help farmers and agricultural experts diagnose plant diseases at an early stage — simply by analyzing images of leaves.

The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a powerful architecture ideal for image classification tasks. It learns from thousands of labeled images of both healthy and diseased leaves and accurately identifies the type of disease in new, unseen images.


With proper training and tuning, the model achieves an accuracy of 92%, demonstrating its ability to generalize well across various types of plant diseases.
